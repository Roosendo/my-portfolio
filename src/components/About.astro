      <p class="text-white text-lg">I earned an Associate Degree in Software Development Engineering from ITCA Fepade San Miguel, forming my educational foundation. Fueled by a passion for learning, I expanded my knowledge independently, delving into JavaScript fundamentals and building RESTful APIs with Express through GitHub and YouTube tutorials, including Midudev's courses. This mix of formal education and online learning enhances my grasp of software development.</p>
