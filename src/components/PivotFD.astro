<FrameDescription
  title='Education'
  body='I earned an Associate Degree in Software Development Engineering from ITCA Fepade San Miguel, which provided me with a strong foundation. However, my passion for learning drove me to expand my knowledge independently. I began by studying GitHub repositories to understand how experienced developers worked, and I also explored various programming YouTube channels. One channel that stood out was Midudev, whose free courses helped me learn everything from JavaScript fundamentals to building RESTful APIs with frameworks like Express. My education combines formal technical studies with self-guided online courses, enhancing my understanding of software development.'
